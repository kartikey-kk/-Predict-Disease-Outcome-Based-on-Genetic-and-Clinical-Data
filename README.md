# -Predict-Disease-Outcome-Based-on-Genetic-and-Clinical-Data

This project is part of the AI Mid-Semester Evaluation (MSE). It involves visualizing breast cancer diagnosis data using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **NumPy**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing genetic and clinical measurements of breast cancer patients, the objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize key patterns to aid diagnosis prediction.
